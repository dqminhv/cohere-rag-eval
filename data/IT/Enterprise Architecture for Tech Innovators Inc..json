{"id": "1540171", "text": "Tech Innovators Inc Enterprise Architecture\n[1]\nOn-Premise Environment\nLegacy System\n:\nFunction\n: An older system or application that may be critical to business operations. It often requires integration with modern systems.\nIntegration Point\n: Connects to the Database Server and App Server for data exchange.\nDatabase Server\n:\nFunction\n: Hosts databases that store critical data. This could be any relational or non-relational database system.\nIntegration Point\n: Connects to the Legacy System and establishes a VPN connection to the Cloud Database for data synchronization.\nApp Server\n:\nFunction\n: Hosts applications that provide business logic and services to users. It may also act as a bridge to the cloud.\nIntegration Point\n: Interacts with the Legacy System for business logic and the cloud environment for extended functionalities.\nCloud Environment\nCloud Database (e.g., RDS)\n:\nFunction\n: A managed database service that provides scalable and reliable data storage in the cloud.\nIntegration Point\n: Syncs with the on-premise Database Server via a secure VPN connection.\nAPI Gateway\n:\nFunction\n: Provides a secure entry point for API requests coming from on-premise applications or external clients.\nIntegration Point\n: Routes requests to appropriate services within the cloud environment, including Compute Instances and Databases.\nCompute Instances\n:\nFunction\n: Virtual machines or containers that run applications and services in the cloud. These can scale based on demand.\nIntegration Point\n: Process data and execute business logic, interacting with both the Cloud Database and the on-premise App Server.\nLoad Balancer\n:\nFunction\n: Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple Compute Instances to ensure high availability and reliability.\nIntegration Point\n: Ensures efficient distribution of requests among Compute Instances.\nIntegration Points\nVPN (Virtual Private Network)\n:\nFunction\n: Establishes a secure and encrypted connection between the on-premise environment and the cloud environment.\nIntegration Point\n: Connects the on-premise Database Server with the Cloud Database, allowing secure data synchronization.\nAPI Calls\n:\nFunction\n: Enables communication between on-premise App Server and cloud services via the API Gateway.\nIntegration Point\n: Facilitates integration between on-premise applications and cloud services, extending the capabilities of on-premise applications with cloud features.\nDiagram Explanation\nThe \nOn-Premise Environment\n contains systems and servers that are physically located within an organization's premises. It includes legacy systems, a database server, and an application server.\nThe \nCloud Environment\n includes managed services and infrastructure provided by a cloud service provider. This setup typically includes cloud databases, API gateways, compute instances, and load balancers.\nA \nVPN\n connection securely bridges the on-premise environment with the cloud, allowing data to flow securely between the two environments.\nAPI calls\n from the on-premise application server to the cloud's API gateway enable integration of on-premise applications with cloud services, allowing for extended functionalities and scalability.\nThis architecture allows an organization to leverage the scalability and flexibility of cloud services while maintaining control over critical on-premise systems.\n\u00a0\nReference: [1]: \nhttps://s-bennett.com/2018/10/13/hybrid-multi-cloud-integration/\n ", "Title": "Enterprise Architecture for Tech Innovators Inc.", "Space": "IT"}
