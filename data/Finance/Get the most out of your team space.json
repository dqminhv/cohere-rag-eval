This could be your team's mission statement or a brief description of the kind of work you do.\nShare team goals.\n Add links to your team's \nOKRs\n, \nproject plans\n, and \nproduct roadmaps\n so visitors can quickly get a sense of your team's goals.\nTell people how to contact you.\n Share your timezone and links to Slack channels, email aliases, or other contact details your team uses so visitors can contact you with questions or feedback about your team's work.\nUse shortcuts for easy access\nShortcuts are helpful for important pages that members of a space might need to get to often. These shortcuts are added and organized by the space administrator. Space admins can link to pages in the space, other related spaces, or relevant external web content as well as reorder the shortcuts as needed.\nStart discussions with inline comments\nThoughtful responses can get lost and lose context as email replies pile up. And if you neglect to copy someone or want to add them later on, it's difficult for them to get up to speed. \nInline comments\n allow anyone (or everyone) to huddle around an idea while referencing key information on the project page.\nTo leave an inline comment, highlight text on the page and the comment icon will appear.\nTeam members with permission to access the page can respond to any comment. Plus, when a comment thread comes to its natural conclusion, comments can be resolved and cleared away.\nLoop in team members with @mentions\n@mentions\n on Confluence function like @mentions on social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Slack. Type the @ symbol on a Confluence page or in a comment, begin spelling a team member's first name, and a list will appear. Select the individual to ask a question or assign a task.\nEndorse ideas with reactions\nUse reactions when you want to support a comment or acknowledge you've seen one without clogging up the thread with another comment.\nYou can also use reactions on a page or blog post. The author of the content will be notified, and if enough team members react or add comments to the content, it'll be surfaced on Confluence home feed\nTake your Confluence space to the next level\nExtend the capabilities of your Confluence pages by  adding extra functionality or including dynamic content.\nTo add functionality:\nType ' / ' to open the list of items available to use\nFind the item to be inserted and select it\nSelect \nInsert\nUseful elements for Team space\nIntroduce the team\nAdd \nuser profiles\n to display a short summary of a given Confluence user's profile with their role, profile photo and contact details.\nShare news and announcements with your team\nDisplay a stream of latest \nblog posts\n so your team can easily see what's been going on.\nDisplay a list of important pages\nPaste in page URLs to create smart links, or use the \ncontent report table\n to create a list of all the pages in the space.", "Title": "Get the most out of your team space", "Space": "Finance"}
