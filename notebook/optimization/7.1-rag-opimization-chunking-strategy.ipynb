    "# Overview\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook is focused on building and evaluating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with different chunking strategies when building the vector database. The notebook consists of several sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Importing Libraries and Environment Setup:** The notebook begins by importing necessary libraries, including `langchain_core`, `langchain_mongodb`, `langchain_openai`, and `dotenv`. It then loads environment variables from a `.env` file using `dotenv`.\n",
    "2.  **Vector Store and Retriever Setup:** Three vector stores (`vector_store_0`, `vector_store_1`, `vector_store_2`) are set up using `MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch` from `langchain_mongodb`. Each vector store is associated with a different MongoDB collection and index name. Three retrievers (`retriever_0`, `retriever_1`, `retriever_2`) are set up using the `as_retriever` method of each vector store.\n",
    "3.  **RAG Pipeline with Chunking Strategy:** Three RAG pipelines are defined, each with a different chunking strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   **Chunking Strategy 0:** This pipeline uses `retriever_0`, with chunk size 200 and overlap 20.\n",
    "    *   **Chunking Strategy 1:** This pipeline uses `retriever_1`, with chunk size 150 and overlap 15.\n",
    "    *   **Chunking Strategy 2:** This pipeline uses `retriever_2`, with chunk size 300 and overlap 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Each pipeline uses a language model (`ChatOpenAI`) to generate answers based on the retrieved documents.\n",
    "4.  **Testing the RAG Pipelines:** Each RAG pipeline is tested with a sample question, and the generated answer is printed.\n",
    "5.  **RAG Pipeline Evaluation:** The notebook prepares a test dataset using a JSON file and evaluates each RAG pipeline using the `evaluate` function from `ragas`. The evaluation metrics include answer relevance, faithfulness, context recall, and context precision.\n",
    "6.  **Saving Evaluation Results:** The evaluation results for each RAG pipeline are saved as a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Functions and Variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `call_openai_0`, `call_openai_1`, `call_openai_2`: These functions define the RAG pipelines with different chunking strategies.\n",
    "*   `vector_store_0`, `vector_store_1`, `vector_store_2`: These variables define the vector stores for the RAG pipelines.\n",
    "*   `retriever_0`, `retriever_1`, `retriever_2`: These variables define the retrievers for the RAG pipelines.\n",
    "*   `llm`: This variable defines the language model used for generating answers.\n",
    "*   `result_0`, `result_1`, `result_2`: These variables store the evaluation results for each RAG pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context and Evaluation Metrics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The notebook uses a test dataset with questions and ground truth answers to evaluate the RAG pipelines.\n",
    "*   The evaluation metrics include answer relevance, faithfulness, context recall, and context precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chunking Strategy Comparison:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The notebook evaluates three different chunking strategies with chunk sizes 200, 150, and 300, and overlaps 20, 15, and 30, respectively.\n",
    "*   The evaluation results are saved as CSV files for each chunking strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice and Future Work:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The notebook can be extended to evaluate more chunking strategies and compare their performance.\n",
    "*   The evaluation metrics can be modified or extended to better assess the performance of the RAG pipelines.\n",
    "*   The notebook can be used as a starting point for building and evaluating RAG pipelines for other use cases and applications.\n"
