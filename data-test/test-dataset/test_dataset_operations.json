        "ground_truth": "Employee engagement and disengagement differ in terms of emotional commitment, motivation, and their relation to labor laws. Engaged employees have a strong emotional commitment to their organization and its goals. They are enthusiastic about their work, take positive action to further the organization's reputation and interests, and are motivated to contribute to its success. On the other hand, disengaged employees may feel disconnected and unmotivated. They lack emotional commitment and may exhibit signs of burnout and cynicism.\n\nIn terms of labor laws, employee engagement is crucial for maintaining a fair and legal workplace. It promotes compliance with labor laws such as equal employment opportunity (EEO), anti-harassment and anti-discrimination policies, wage and hour laws, and occupational safety and health regulations. Engaged employees are more likely to adhere to these laws and contribute to a positive work environment.\n\nIn contrast, disengaged employees may be less motivated to comply with labor laws and may exhibit behaviors that violate these laws, such as harassment or discrimination. Disengagement can also lead to decreased productivity and increased turnover, which can have legal implications for the organization.\n\nOverall, employee engagement and disengagement have significant implications for emotional commitment, motivation, and compliance with labor laws."

Split Documents into Chunks: The cleaned documents are split into smaller chunks using a text splitter. This helps in efficient indexing and retrieval of specific information.\n\n3. Indexing Data for Retrieval: The Pinecone vector database is initialized and an index is created. The embeddings of the chunks are computed using the OpenAI embeddings model and indexed in Pinecone. This allows for fast and accurate retrieval of relevant documents.\n\n4. Define the Retrieval Function: The retrieval function is defined using the PineconeRetriever class. This function takes a query as input and retrieves the most relevant documents based on the embeddings and similarity scores.\n\nThese steps ensure that the data in the RAG application is processed, organized, and retrievable for generating accurate and relevant responses."
