{"id": "1540667", "text": "The T-shaped person concept has a 30+ year tenure in recruiting and employee development. Now, apply it to your customer strategy to grow richer engagement.\nThis article embraces a simple goal \u2014 keep more customers, and keep them longer\n. We know customers leave for many reasons. They stay when they love a product, feel like they gain significant value from it, or perceive switching \u2014 from it, to another \u2014 as too costly or painful.\nTo help organizations realize that goal, the article introduces a business strategy tool, the \nT-shaped Persona. \nThe tool helps us target the minimally engaged customer, and assess her awareness of our product\u2019s features. The tool also helps us develop tactics to help our user find \nfeatures \nthat \nother\n users love \u2014 with our hope being \u2014 she will love them too. As we said above, \ncustomers stay\n when they love a product.\nKey Concepts\nA \npersona \nis an abstract representation of a typical user or customer. We often focus on the \nbuyer persona\n and the moments-that-matter for our \nbuyer\u2019s journey\n. This article focuses on the \ncustomer\n already using our product or service.\nA \nfeature\n is an important part, quality or ability of a \nproduct\n that makes it distinct or better; it usually contributes to the overall value proposition.\nA \nproduct feature matrix \nmaps product(s) on one axis, to features on an intersecting axis. It is typically used to compare competing, similar products, or differentiate a product\u2019s versions from product Gamma to Gamma+, Gamma 2.0 and so on.\nThe \nT-Shaped person \nis a talent management concept,\n attributed to McKinsey & Company\n, that describes the depth or domain expertise of an individual along the vertical stroke of the letter \u2018T\u2019, while also describing that same individual\u2019s breadth across varied other disciplines along the \u2018T\u2019 horizontal bar.\nA \nT-Shaped Persona \nis a \nnew concept.\n It\u2019s a business strategy tool, similar to the talent concept above, visualized by a \u2018T\u2019; it also conveys a breadth and depth. Its differences start with its job \u2014 \nact as a visual guide to inspect a persona\u2019s adoption and use of our product(s). \nThe vertical stroke of the letter \u2018T\u2019 signifies \ndepth of\n \nproduct\n \nexperience\n, while the \u2018T\u2019 horizontal conveys typical \npersona\n attributes like geographic, firmographic, occupational, and other traits.\nBy adding gradients of \nfeature \nadoption to our user \npersona, \nwe can better understand different levels of expertise amongst users.\nImage 1: the \nT-Shaped Persona\n affords us with a broad and deep view of our customer and her adoption and expertise with our product\nThis understanding affords us opportunity to ask different questions:\nWhat is it about this persona that makes them so successful with our product? What can we learn about product-fit? Will our lookalike segments also engage as deeply? \nThis understanding also affords us \nopportunities to engage differently\n.\nAnecdotal start\nAt the dawn of time (for me, \nprofessionally\n-\nspeaking\n), I spent time in financial services; early days of online banking. It was there that I first came to understand the concept of a \u201csticky service,\u201d exemplified at that time in a feature called, Bill Pay. The \u2018sticky\u2019 nature? \nWhen customers enabled bill pay features \u2014 they seldom left\n.\nThe \u201csticky service\u201d was a galvanizing concept for business and technology. Dev teams worked with added focus to remove friction from the sign up experience. Assurance functions were created to monitor its health. As we matured, \ntwo\n \nquestions\n emerged\u2014 \nHow can we create more sticky services, and how can we get all of our customers to adopt these features?\nThe Recipe\nFollow along and combine the ingredients below. Just like a cookbook author assumes the chef has basic supplies, I\u2019ll assume you\u2019re ready to engage your customer. Just like a baker needs pans, bowls, a mixer and so on, the \norganization needs tools\n for success in digital engagement.\nKnow the customer\nWe need more than just a basic buyer or \nuser persona\n. We need to be able to interact with the customer to change her behavior. At a minimum, we want to be able to build upon current usage data. We also need \nmarketing automation\n \ncapability\n including things like journey management, segmentation and activation.\nKnow the product\nYou should have a \nproduct feature matrix\n. The instrumentation of our product usage should be organized and made consumable in a way that allows us to correlate our users\u2019 use of features to the same language we use to talk about the product. The fictitious, GreenGrass Health, product feature matrix below is a reasonable example. A quick look via your search engine will reveal hundreds of examples.\nTable 1: example\n product feature matrix \nfor GreenGrass Health\u2019s App II.\nName your product usage levels\nFeature list in hand, assess how your users progress through awareness and adoption of those features. Use that information to name the \nlevels of expertise\n. Recall, these represent \ndepth\n, or the vertical bar of our T-Shaped Persona. These should be a spectrum or range. Our GreenGrass Health example continues below, and it spans from \u2018New\u2019 to \u2018Advocate\u2019.\nImage 2: Identify \nlevels of expertise\n. Example includes 5 levels: New, Basic, Explorer, Adept and Advocate.\nMap names to feature awareness depth\nStart with a feature list. Use the data you have about your product features, and attempt to sort it by feature adoption \u2014 most advanced to most basic. Your product feature matrix is a good start.\nFor example, in Table-1 above, GreenGrass Health\u2019s \nproduct feature matrix\n, we show product versions, column by column, showing the improvements from version I to version II. The matrix is a good place to start from as we already know these are features we market, because (hopefully) these are features we know our users care about.\nNow, lay out the \nlevels of expertise, \nleft to right to plot your intersecting chart. Assign values to those intersecting points. We use \nempty circle\n to denote that the user is \naware \nof the feature; \nfull circle\n means \nuse \nof the feature. The view begins to tell a story.\nImage 3: Product feature awareness for named experience levels; while the New user is aware of only 2 features; the Explorer is aware of most all features and actively uses 3 key features. Advocate uses all.\nAdd the Persona to complete the \u2018T\u2019\nWith awareness of our product\u2019s features plotted out, it\u2019s time to overlay our persona as the horizontal bar of the \u2018T\u2019. We\u2019ve outlined two examples, Zooey and Shay. Each persona has different traits and characteristics, and GreenGrass Health needs tactics to be successful with both of these personas.\nMeet Zooey, ideal customer\nThe Zooey persona seems to like the GreenGrass Health app. She seems to engage with its features in steady progression, and the fact is that the distribution shows our Zooey is likely an ideal customer for this product with only 20% participating as only New or Basic.\nImage 4: T-Shaped Persona \u2014 Zooey. Breadth and depth made visible to allow for GreenGrass Health to engage Zooey and help her get find the best features of their product\nMeet Shay, churn risk\nGreenGrass Health has to think about Shay, next. Shay doesn\u2019t adopt in the same way, and in fact Shay often simply stops with Billing and Payments features, and never goes much further. As a result, Shay is more likely to leave GreenGrass Health. He doesn\u2019t love the product, and doesn\u2019t get much value from it.\nImage 5: T-Shaped Persona \u2014 Shay. Breadth and depth made visible with plans to engage Shay differently, in the hope that we can change his use and adoption.\nOpportunity to engage differently\nYou\u2019ll observe that each GreenGrass Health has an action\n plan \nfor Shay. GGH has marked up the T-Shaped Persona for Shay with action details:\nThe \nBasic\n and \nExplorer \nlevels are identified as the places where GGH will take action.\nThe \nCall-to-Action\n that GGH has in mind has a clear outcome in mind \u2014 get Shay to adopt Health Records Management, which is now starred on the table above it in the \nAdept\n column.\nIn this case, GGH is working under the hypothesis that Health Records Management will be the most valuable, \nand most sticky feature,\n of their app. The hope is that when Shay adopts, it will truly be that feature that will keep him engaged, and prevent his churning away. Through the insight gained, and made visual using the T-Shaped Persona, GGH plans on shifting the Shay persona\u2019s product depth distribution through \ntargeted engagement \nthat will bring Shay to \nfind and use a feature he should love\n.\nClosing\nIf you\u2019re an executive, technologist, marketer or product owner responsible for creating a better customer experience, there are \nfantastic outcomes\n here for you in this practice. Improved brand, improved product stickiness, reduced churn and greater \ncustomer lifetime value\n all contribute to greater revenue. As a \nsecondary benefit\n, recall the galvanizing comment from my anecdotal start? This customer-product-fit understanding can benefit your internal teams, affording them insights so they can create more compelling products and experiences.\nDoes your product meet the needs of all your customers, equally? Do you have a sticky service? Do you know which features are more valuable than the next for different, but similar customers? My final counsel \u2014 explore these nuances. Do the work to understand your customers, and have a clear view of how your product meets their needs. The T-Shaped Persona is a great tool to help make this visual and actionable.\nThank you\nThank you for reading. As always, much gratitude to those along the way that influenced me and helped nurture my craft.", "Title": "T-Shaped Personas for +Customer Lifetime Value", "Space": "Research and Development"}
