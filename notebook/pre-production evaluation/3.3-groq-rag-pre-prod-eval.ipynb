    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided Jupyter notebook performs a pre-production evaluation of a Reading and Writing Assistant (RAG) system using a synthetic dataset. The notebook consists of several sections that can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Environment Setup and Data Loading**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The notebook begins by setting up the environment by loading environment variables from a `.env` file using the `dotenv` library.\n",
    "- It then loads synthetic data generated by another Jupyter notebook (`1-ragas-synthetic-test-data-generation.ipynb`) containing question-ground truth pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Data Preparation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The notebook defines several functions for serializing and deserializing data:\n",
    "  - `serialize_list` and `deserialize_list` functions convert lists to JSON strings and vice versa.\n",
    "  - `save_dataframe_with_list_column` and `load_dataframe_with_list_column` functions save and load pandas DataFrames with list columns to/from CSV files while preserving list structures.\n",
    "- These functions are used to prepare the test data for evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Loading Test Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The notebook loads test data from a JSON file (`test_dataset_hr_groq.json`) generated by another Jupyter notebook (`2-chat-history-extraction.ipynb`) using the `json_to_dataframe` function.\n",
    "- The test data is converted into a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Converting to RAGAS Data Format**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The loaded test data is converted into the RAGAS dataset format using the `Dataset` class from the `datasets` library.\n",
    "- The data is organized into columns for questions, answers, contexts, and ground truths.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The notebook performs an evaluation of the RAG system using the `evaluate` function from the `ragas` library.\n",
    "- The evaluation metrics used are answer relevancy, faithfulness, context recall, and context precision.\n",
    "- The results are stored in a pandas DataFrame and saved to a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation Metrics**\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook evaluates the RAG system using the following metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Answer Relevancy**: measures the relevance of the generated answer to the question.\n",
    "- **Faithfulness**: measures the accuracy of the generated answer with respect to the context.\n",
    "- **Context Recall**: measures the proportion of context information included in the generated answer.\n",
    "- **Context Precision**: measures the proportion of generated answer that is relevant to the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The notebook outputs the evaluation results in a pandas DataFrame and saves it to a CSV file (`eval_result_pre_prod_dataset_hr_groq_deployment.csv`).**\n"
