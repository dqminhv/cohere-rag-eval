The application will be trained on custom data sourced from enterprise Confluence pages. RAG combines retrieval-based methods with generative models,']","Data in the RAG application using LangChain is processed and organized through several steps:

1. Clean and Prepare Data: The HTML content of the documents is cleaned using BeautifulSoup to remove any HTML tags and extract the text. This ensures that the data is in a readable format.

2. Split Documents into Chunks: The cleaned documents are split into smaller chunks using a text splitter. This helps in efficient indexing and retrieval of specific information.

3. Indexing Data for Retrieval: The Pinecone vector database is initialized and an index is created. The embeddings of the chunks are computed using the OpenAI embeddings model and indexed in Pinecone. This allows for fast and accurate retrieval of relevant documents.

4. Define the Retrieval Function: The retrieval function is defined using the PineconeRetriever class. This function takes a query as input and retrieves the most relevant documents based on the embeddings and similarity scores.

These steps ensure that the data in the RAG application is processed, organized, and retrievable for generating accurate and relevant responses.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.99999999995

 'necessary information and guidance.Compliance: Employees must adhere to all labor laws and company policies. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action and affect their employment status.7.2 Reporting ViolationsDuty to Report: Employees have a duty to report any violations of labor laws or']","Employee engagement and disengagement differ in terms of emotional commitment, motivation, and their relation to labor laws. Engaged employees have a strong emotional commitment to their organization and its goals. They are enthusiastic about their work, take positive action to further the organization's reputation and interests, and are motivated to contribute to its success. On the other hand, disengaged employees may feel disconnected and unmotivated. They lack emotional commitment and may exhibit signs of burnout and cynicism.

In terms of labor laws, employee engagement is crucial for maintaining a fair and legal workplace. It promotes compliance with labor laws such as equal employment opportunity (EEO), anti-harassment and anti-discrimination policies, wage and hour laws, and occupational safety and health regulations. Engaged employees are more likely to adhere to these laws and contribute to a positive work environment.

In contrast, disengaged employees may be less motivated to comply with labor laws and may exhibit behaviors that violate these laws, such as harassment or discrimination. Disengagement can also lead to decreased productivity and increased turnover, which can have legal implications for the organization.

Overall, employee engagement and disengagement have significant implications for emotional commitment, motivation, and compliance with labor laws.",0.8379439054859192,1.0,0.7272727272727273,0.999999999975
