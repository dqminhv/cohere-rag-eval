    "ground_truth":"Data in the RAG application using LangChain is processed and organized through several steps:\n\n1. Clean and Prepare Data: The HTML content of the documents is cleaned using BeautifulSoup to remove any HTML tags and extract the text. This ensures that the data is in a readable format.\n\n2. Split Documents into Chunks: The cleaned documents are split into smaller chunks using a text splitter. This helps in efficient indexing and retrieval of specific information.\n\n3. Indexing Data for Retrieval: The Pinecone vector database is initialized and an index is created. The embeddings of the chunks are computed using the OpenAI embeddings model and indexed in Pinecone. This allows for fast and accurate retrieval of relevant documents.\n\n4. Define the Retrieval Function: The retrieval function is defined using the PineconeRetriever class. This function takes a query as input and retrieves the most relevant documents based on the embeddings and similarity scores.\n\nThese steps ensure that the data in the RAG application is processed, organized, and retrievable for generating accurate and relevant responses."
