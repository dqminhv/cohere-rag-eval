# Cohere Toolkit RAG Evaluation

**RAG Pipeline Evaluation and Optimization**

This repository is a part of Enterprise-Search-Chatbot project at fellowship.ai. It offers a comprehensive toolkit for evaluating and refining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines built from Cohere toolkit. It utilizes RAGAS and LangSmith for evaluation. 

**Core Functionalities:**

* **Synthetic Test Data Generation:**
  - Create diverse and challenging question-answer pairs using the RAGAS framework.
  - This ensures a thorough evaluation of your RAG system's capabilities.

* **RAG Component Optimization:**
  - Delve into the optimization of various RAG components, enabling you to fine-tune your system for optimal performance:
    - **a) Chunking Strategy:**  Investigate how different approaches to splitting text into chunks impact retrieval and generation quality.
    - **b) Prompt Templates:**  Experiment with various prompts to guide the large language model (LLM) and influence the quality and direction of its responses.
    - **c) Query Transformation:**  Explore techniques for transforming user queries into forms that enhance retrieval and generation effectiveness.
    - **d) Reranking:**  Evaluate the impact of reranking retrieved documents on the final response selection process.

* **Chat History Extraction:**
  - Extract chat history from a running Cohere toolkit Docker container for post-production evaluation.
  - Analyze real-world user interactions to gauge system effectiveness.

* **Multi-Stage Evaluation:**
  - Conduct evaluations at different stages of the RAG pipeline's lifecycle:
    - **Pre-Production:** Employ predefined test data and ground truth to assess general performance metrics like answer relevancy and faithfulness.
    - **Post-Production:** Analyze real-world user queries and system responses to understand user experience and identify areas for improvement.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
    - Install Python (version 3.6 or later recommended).
    - Install required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    - Set up a Cohere toolkit Docker container (refer to Cohere documentation).

2. **Running the Notebooks:**
    - Launch Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the repository directory.
    - Each notebook provides detailed instructions and expected inputs to facilitate your exploration.

**Envisioning the Future:**

* **Automated Testing:** Integrate automated testing tools to streamline the evaluation process and ensure consistent performance over time.
* **Benchmarking:** Incorporate standardized benchmarks for RAG performance, enabling comparisons with other systems and tracking progress.
* **Deployment Pipeline:** Develop a robust deployment pipeline to seamlessly integrate the optimized RAG system into the production environment.
* **Visualization Tools:** Implement visualization tools to provide intuitive insights into the behavior and decision-making processes within the RAG pipeline.
